#Intro
The docker image will be designed to provide a simple apache webserver to serve
the static html/css/javascript files to a client. This will allow a convenient
means to test Theresa's Jukebox Hero project.

#todo
* Create a dockerfile to generate a container with nodejs and apache.
* Create a method to load the latest files into the container.
* Create a script to launch the docker container in a standard way.
