javascript webpage quiz

Series of questions that will test users on their knowledge of music within a genre type. Users will input general information about themselves in order to compare their score with other users. The goal is for the information to be stored in an array that can be referenced at later dates. At the end of the ‘test’ the user will be given a score and a ranking for their genre, then an overall ranking.

Example of User Information

Name: (textbox)
Genre: (drop down menu)
Date: (fixed based on current date)

Example of Question

Finish the lyrics

I got a pocket for every reason, every season be another day,
I gotta pack, gotta _ _ _ _     _ _     _ _ _     _ _ _ _ _
I love my Louie when I go away

3)	Tony	150	Oldies		12/01/17
4)	Caroline	100	Swing		12/01/17

The test will need to validate the user information before beginning, then ensure the correct number of guesses are input per question. The simple version will give a flat score, the mid version will allow streak bonuses, and the complex version will give a time bonus in addition to the streak bonus. Arrays will be used to contain the information about each song separated by genre, so country music information won’t get mixed in with metal.
